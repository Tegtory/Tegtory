# Philosophy

Project architecture was built with clean code in mind. So here you can find some layers (domain, infrastructure, presenters), CQRS, Entities, Dependency injection and other


## `domain/` - clean business logic

### `domain/commands domain/queries` - Commands/Queries data declaration

```python
# domain/commands/shop.py
from domain.commands.base import BaseCommand

class CreateShopCommand(BaseCommand): # 1
    title: str
```

1. every command/query must have *Command/*Query naming and must inherit Base(Command/Query)

### `domain/entities` - Data transfer object or just Entities

we want to create a unit that have: title, health, mana

```python
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass(kw_only=True) # 1
class Unit:
    title: str
    health: int = 100
    mana: int = 100
```

1. With entities, we work only with kw_only=True

**_WARN: for now using pydantic or dataclasses is under discussion, then final decision come up entities, commands, queries will be updated_**

### `domain/interfaces` - repository protocols

we want to get all units, but in domain layer we can't work with real database, what we need to do?

1. define protocol

    ```python
   from typing import Protocol
   
   class CrudRepository(Protocol):
       async def all(self) -> list: # 1
           pass # 2
    ```

2. use it in command/query handler
    ```python

    ```


- #1 All protocols functions must be async, and typed
- #2 don't write logic, only declaration

---


# Commit/Push rules

## Automated check (Recommended)

1. set-up pre-commit
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

now when using `git commit -m ""` tests will check automatically

## Manual Check

before every commit/push ensure that all linters and tests passed

```bash
ruff format # format code to keep it clean
pytest # check that all existing functional working
mypy . # check that all functions typed correctly
ruff check --fix # check some coding format rules
```

this page is under TODO, be patient. It will be updated very soon
